    <h1>Pseudo-Elementos CSS</h1>
    <div class="section">

        <div class="corp">
            <h2>1. p::first-line</h2>
            <p class="line">Nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot. Just… Remember I’m here. Right now you
                maybe don’t
                wanna feel anything… Maybe you’ll never want to feel anything. And… Maybe it’s not to me you wanna speak
                about these things but… Hm… Feel something you obviously did.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="corp">
            <h2>2. p::first-letter</h2>
            <p class="letter">You two had a beautiful friendship. Maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you. In my
                place, most parents would wish the whole thing goes away… And pray their sons land on their feet. But… I
                am not such a parent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="corp">
            <h2>3. p::before</h2>
            <p class="before">We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster that we go bankrupt by the
                age of thirty and
                have less to offer each time we start with someone new.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="corp">
            <h2>4. p::after</h2>
            <p class="after">But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything — what a waste! Have I spoken
                too much? Then let me say one more thing. It’ll clear the air.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="corp">
            <h2>5. p::selection</h2>
            <p class="selection">I may have come close, but I never had what you two have. Something always held me back
                or stood in the way. How you live your life is your business, just remember, our hearts and our bodies
                are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there
                comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now, there’s sorrow, pain.
                Don’t kill it and with it the joy you’ve felt.</p>
